# TS patterns

**I have an interest in TS, and I decided to write patterns to investigate it.**

If you see some errors, feel free make an issue or report me about it and you're always welcome to optimize and impove these examples >(^_^)<

You can use this command to run the examples:

```javascript
npx ts-node **/index.ts
``` 
*(ts-node runs ts on the fly)*
