# TS patterns

**I have an interest in TS, and I decided to write patterns to investigate it.**

If you see errors or you can tell me about the best practices, ways to improve and optimize, please contact me >(^_^)<

I use this to run examples:

```javascript
npx ts-node **/index.ts
``` 
*(ts-node runs ts on the fly)*
